The libvoxin library eases the integration of voxin on 64 bits architectures.

This repository concerns the development of libvoxin.
To build the voxin installer and its dependencies, please check instead the [[https://github.com/Oralux/voxin-installer][voxin-installer]] repository.

Below we detail how to compile libvoxin and test it.
By default, a fake libibmeci.so is provided.

* Compil
** Build the libvoxin tarballs
 
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./build.sh --release
#+END_SRC

** Build with debug symbols + tests
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./build.sh -td
#+END_SRC

** Create a testing directory
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./test.sh -b list

# this 'list' file provides the paths to the necessary tarballs.
# the common tarballs (*all*, *voxind*) are expected to be placed 
# at the beginning of the list

# For example to test English and French, these paths would be:

/home/user1/voxin-2.0/voxin-enu-2.0/packages/all/rfs_2.0.all.txz
/home/user1/voxin-2.0/voxin-enu-2.0/packages/all/voxin-viavoice-all_6.7-1.0-1.txz
/home/user1/voxin-2.0/voxin-enu-2.0/packages/all/voxin-viavoice-enu_6.7-1.0-1.txz
/home/user1/voxin-2.0/voxin-fra-2.0/packages/all/voxin-viavoice-fra_6.7-1.0-1.txz

#+END_SRC

** Run test 1
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./test.sh -t 1
#+END_SRC

** Delete the testing directory
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./test.sh -d
#+END_SRC

* Test with TTS
* Memo: version 
The program version is stored in src/api/voxin.h
