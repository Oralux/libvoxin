# voxin.ini (version 1.5.7)
#
# voxin.ini defines the default values of several parameters for the
# IBM TTS or Vocalizer Embedded voices.
#
# voxin.ini will be read at $HOME/.config/voxin/voxin.ini or
# otherwise at /var/opt/oralux/voxin/voxin.ini
#
# Two sections:
# - general: concerns the IBM TTS or Vocalizer Embedded voices
# - viavoice: only for IBM TTS
#
# In the following lines, all the parameters are commented out and
# assigned to their default values.
#


# The general section concerns any IBM TTS or Vocalizer Embedded
# voice
[general]

# The capitalization parameter authorizes to play a sound icon before
# each word with a capital letter.
# Expected values: none, icon
# By default, no sound icon
#capitalization=none

# The punctuation parameter indicates which punctuation characeters
# must be spelled.
# Expected values: none, some, all
# By default no punctuation is spelled
#punctuation=none

# The somePunctuation parameter supplies the list of punctuation
# character to be spelled if punctuation has been set to "some"
#somePunctuation=(),? 

# voiceName indicates the default voice.
#
# For example, to choose the Zoe voice in a system where two Voxin
# voices have been installed:
#
# 1. retrieve the  exact name of the Zoe voice using:
# voxin-say -L
# which would return in this example:
#
# Name,Language,Variant
# american_english,en,US
# zoe-embedded-compact,en,US
#
# 2. update the voiceName parameter in voxin.ini:
# voiceName=zoe-embedded-compact

# The viavoice section concerns any IBM TTS language
[viavoice]

# The useAbbreviation parameter enables the abbreviation dictionaries.
# Expected Values: yes or no
# By default no abbreviation
#useAbbreviation=no

# dictionaryDir:
# Note that this description has been copied and slightly customized
# from speech-dispatcher (voxin.conf, IbmttsDictionaryFolder comment).
#
# IBM TTS supports user dictionaries so that you may customize the
# pronunciation of words, beginning of words or abbreviations
# according to the language.
# 
# The dictionaryDir parameter defines the root directory under which
# you may add your dictionary files. If several languages are
# installed, you may want to create one sub-directory per language.
#
# Three examples : 
# 
# - a single language is installed:
#   place your files under dictionaryDir
# 
# - two languages are installed, say English and French:
#   place your files under dictionaryDir in sub-directories en and fr
# 
# - the same language for different regions are installed, say
#   Castilian Spanish and Mexican Spanish:
#   place your files in directories es_ES and es_MX
# 
# The directory names are listed below (DIRECTORY NAMES and EXTENDED
# DIRECTORY NAMES).
#
# The name of the dictionary files are:
#
# - main.dct: main dictionary
# - root.dct: roots dictionary
# - abbreviation.dct: abbreviation dictionary 
# - extension.dct: main extension dictionary
#
# The IBM TTS documentation details the syntax of the user
# dictionaries.
# Basically, it is one line per entry, composed of key, tabulation,
# value.
